# Streamflow drought forecasts

> _A newer version of the software may be available. See https://code.usgs.gov/wma/vizlab/streamflow-drought-forecasts/-/releases to view all releases._

This repo uses R, JavaScript, Vue, and Mapbox to build an interactive map of experimental streamflow drought forecasts for the conterminous United States. 

**The data visualization website can be viewed at [https://water.usgs.gov/vizlab/streamflow-drought-forecasts](https://water.usgs.gov/vizlab/streamflow-drought-forecasts).**

## Building the website locally

Clone the repo. In the directory, run `npm install` to install the required modules. Once the dependencies have been installed, run `npm run dev` to run locally from your browser. Note that you will need to have a local copy of the Mapbox development token to build the site.

To build the website locally you'll need `npm v20` and `node v8.1` or higher installed. To manage multiple versions of `npm`, you may [try using `nvm`](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-change-node-js-version-between-projects-using-nvm-3ad2416bda7e).
